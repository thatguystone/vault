VAULT(1)
========
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
vault - manage an encrypted, file-backed filesystem


SYNOPSIS
--------
*vault*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Vault is like TrueCrypt: it creates a file-backed encrypted dev where you can
store all your files. This is just a thin wrapper around cryptsetup with some
niceness to make managing the vault easier.

When dealing with sizes, you may use human-readable values such as "100m" or
"100mb" for 100 megabytes, "10g" or "10gb" for 10 gigabytes, and so forth.

COMMANDS
--------

*open*::

	Open an existing vault.

*close*::

	Close an opened vault. Close path may either be vault device path or mount
	path.

*create*::

	Create and open a new vault.

	*--no-randomize*;;

		If the vault file should not be randomized after creation. This is not
		recommended.

	*--fs-type*=ext4;;

		Which filesystem to use

	*--cipher-mode*=xts-plain64;;

		Any cipher mode supported by cryptsetup, without the aes- prefix

	*--hash*=sha1;;

		Hash to use for PBKDF2 function

	*--iter-time*=1000;;

		How long to iterate on the password with PBKDF2, in milliseconds.

	*--use-urandom*;;

		Use /dev/urandom instead of cryptsetup's default; really only useful
		for testing.

*grow*::

	Increase the size of the vault by the given amount.

*shrink*::

	Decrease the size of the vault by the given amount.


EXAMPLES
--------

Create a new vault with all defaults::

	sudo vault create secret.vlt 100m

Create a new vault and mount it at a custom location::

	sudo vault create secret.vlt 100m /mnt/secrets

Create a new vault with a different filesystem::

	sudo vault create --fs-type=ext2 secret.vlt 100m

Create a new vault that isn't inited randomed (this is not recommended)::

	sudo vault create --no-random secret.vlt 100m

Open a vault::

	sudo vault open secret.vlt

Open a vault and mount it at a custom location::

	sudo vault open secret.vlt /mnt/secrets

Close a vault (from its file)::

	sudo vault close secret.vlt

Close a vault (from its device)::

	sudo vault close /dev/mapper/vault-device

Close a vault (from its mount location)::

	sudo vault close /mnt/secrets

Increase vault size by 100m::

	sudo vault grow secrets.vlt 100m

Shrink vault size by 100m::

	sudo vault shrink secrets.vlt 100m
